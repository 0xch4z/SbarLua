# SketchyBar Lua Plugin
This project wraps the SketchyBar API in LUA. This is done by using kernel
level inter-process communication between SketchyBar and the LUA module, such
that we do not have to alter the source code of SketchyBar at all.
The project is in early development, if you want to see how it can be used have
a look at the example in the example folder, which is a fully working
sketchybar config in LUA which should work out of the box with the current
SketchyBar version.

Feel free to contribute to this repo.
